                            I'm a former football coach with a strong belief in individual development and the power of genuine relationships.
                            Throughout my coaching career, I focused on understanding each player as a person, not just an athlete—because true growth comes from trust and personal attention.
                            Today, I run a football agency shaped by the same philosophy. My mission is to guide and support players on their journey,
                            both on and off the pitch, with honesty, ambition, and a deeply personal approach.

                            As a licensed football agent and law student specializing in contract law, I combine legal expertise with a lifelong passion for football.
                            My background gives me a strong foundation in the complexities of negotiations, player agreements, and long-term career planning.
                            Football has always been more than a game to me—it’s a driving force. My goal is to ensure that every player I represent is protected,
                            supported, and given the best conditions to grow, both professionally and personally. With a clear legal perspective and genuine dedication to the sport,
                            I work to safeguard players’ interests and open doors to new opportunities.
